<h1> Data protection information </h1>
<p> We thank you for our interest in our Study “A UniversalWeb Accessibility Feedback Form”. We study the use of a
    feedback tool for web accessibility. We want to understand how people interact with the feedback tool and the
    resulting feedback. In the following, we provide information about data protection.</p>

<h2>1. Personal Data</h2>
<p>Within the scope of your participation in the above study, we will be processing personal data of the participants.
    According to Art. 4 Nr. 1 of the European GDPR, ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or
    identifiable natural person.
</p>
<p> Within this study, these are the following pieces of information concerning you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Description of the feedback</li>
    <li>Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies</li>
    <li>Browser, operating system</li>
    <li>Files like screenshots</li>
    <li>Name, email, phone</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Person Responsible</h2>
<p>Responsible for the data processing within the scope of the GDPR as well as other data protection regulations is:</p>
<p> The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is a body governed by public law. It is represented by President Prof.
    Dr.-Ing. Holger Hanselka.</p>

<h2>3. Purpose of data processing</h2>
<p>KIT processes your personal data solely for specified, unambiguous and legitimate purposes. The purpose of the data
    processing in the present is to carry out the study “Designing a Feedback Tool for Web Accessibility”.</p>

<h2> 4. Legal basis for data processing</h2>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is your consent in accordance with Art. 6, Abs. 1 a) of
    GDPR.<br aria-hidden="true"/>
    Consent is granted voluntarily. Consent can be revoked at any time with the effect for the future. Effect for the
    future means that a withdrawal of consent does not affect the legality of the processing carried out based on the
    consent until the revocation.
    If consent is refused or revoked, there are no disadvantages.</p>

<h2>5. Description of data processing</h2>
<p> Users can fill out the feedback form. After clicking the submit button, the data will be transferred. If the user
    wishes to receive a copy of the feedback by email, the email address provided will only be used for
    this purpose. To evaluate the feedback tool for the study, the transferred feedback is used.
    All data collected during the study will be strictly confidentially and stored, further processed, and evaluated and
    will only be shared with the research partners at KIT in pseudonymised form. The dataset will be given a randomized
    ID number. This ensures that no conclusions about you are possible.
    The table containing the feedback data will be deleted immediately after the completion of the study, so that no
    assignment to your person is possible anymore. Your name, email, and phone are then removed from the research data.
    The anonymized research data will be kept for research and may be published in a report or journal article or
    presented to interested parties, including possibly, blog article but not exclusively, members of editorial boards
    or scientific committees.
    The results of the study are published exclusively in anonymized and/or aggregated form.</p>
<p>Participation of the study is voluntary. You will not be at a disadvantage if you do not decide to participate in the
    study. Even if you have given your consent to participate, you can cancel your participation at any time, with or
    without giving reasons. If you wish, the collected data will be deleted in full or in part. This is only possible
    until the deletion of your name, email, and phone from the research data. Subsequently, the data can no longer be
    assigned to individual persons.</p>

<h2>6. Recipient</h2>
<p>In principle, your personal data will not be transmitted to third parties.<br aria-hidden="true"/>
    If it is exceptionally necessary for external service providers to process personal data for us on behalf of us,
    these are carefully selected by us and contractually obliged. The respective service providers will work exclusively
    according to our instructions. We ensure this through strict contractual regulations, technical and organisational
    measures and additional controls.
    There is no transfer of personal data to third countries outside the EU or the EEA or to an international
    organisation. Automated decision-making, including profiling, is not performed.</p>

<h2>7. Storage time</h2>
<p> The name, email, and phone will be deleted immediately after completing the evaluation. The anonymized research data
    will be kept for research and might be published in a report, blog article or journal article.</p>

<h2>8. Rights</h2>
